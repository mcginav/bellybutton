# Belly Button Diversity Study
#### I have created three charts to visualize the bacteria found in the belly buttons of each of Roza's volunteers. These charts are interactive, so her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If Improbable Beef identifies a species of bacteria as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
#### I have customized the dashboard by
* Changing the color scheme for the bubble chart
* Changing the colors and border for the gauge chart
* Changing the font used in the gauge chart
